# ProjectileMotionSim
My Projectile Motion Simulator is a physics simulator created in Java. It uses the Processing 3 library for all of its GUI and visuals. I created it when I was 17 so I could practice programming and I ended up submitting it to the 2020 Congressional App Challenge.

Here is a link to the demo I submitted to the Congressional App Challenge showing off my application:
